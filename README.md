## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains my capstone project for the Design Thinking course, featuring an interactive web application that demonstrates the complete design thinking process and showcases a real-world implementation through a **Time Management App**. The project reflects my journey through the five stages of design thinking and presents key insights gained during the course.

## 🎯 What is Design Thinking?

Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that integrates the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and requirements for business success. This project demonstrates the five-stage process:

### 🔄 The Five Stages

1. **🤝 Empathize** - Understanding user needs, experiences, and challenges
2. **📝 Define** - Clearly articulating the problem statement
3. **💡 Ideate** - Generating creative solutions and ideas
4. **🛠️ Prototype** - Building representations of potential solutions
5. **✅ Test** - Gathering feedback and refining solutions

## 🚀 Featured Project: Time Management App

The centerpiece of this repository is a **Time Management Application** that addresses procrastination and time management challenges faced by students and professionals.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Managing multiple tasks within limited time while battling procrastination is a common challenge that affects productivity, creates stress, and impacts overall well-being.

### 💡 Our Solution
An interactive application that helps users:
- ✅ Identify root causes of time management issues
- 📊 Track and analyze time usage patterns
- 🎯 Implement customized strategies to overcome procrastination
- 📈 Set realistic goals and track progress over time
